# Java-Field
Java Field game made for Monash online Java Programming unit.
Details of the game are explained in the introduction text, however some information around the rules are deliberately obfuscated.
The main block is within the Field class. 
One limitation of the program is in the requirement to use only 1 dimensional arrays rather than 2 dimensional arrays, which would make more sense given the grid play space of the game.
